# Blocks opening/updating a PR until: the active feature (matched by the
# current branch name) is Complete with every task checked, its
# Feature-tier pre-flight gates are clean AND were actually committed
# before implementation started (not backfilled after the fact -- the
# exact failure this gate exists to catch), and nothing is sitting
# uncommitted. This exits nonzero rather than leaving the decision to
# whoever reads the JSON below -- and never accepts freshly-authored gate
# files as a fix, only ones that predate the implementation commits.
